I am truly sorry for the way I behaved yesterday. I know I hurt you deeply with my words and actions, and I regret it more than I can express. I was in a bad place emotionally and took it out on you, which was completely unfair and uncalled for. Please know that I am truly sorry and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You mean so much to me and I hate knowing that I caused you pain. I will do everything in my power to make it right and to show you how much I care about you.
